class bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]])
Return a new ¡°bytes¡± object, which is an immutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. bytes is an immutable version of bytearray ¨C it has the same non-mutating methods and the same indexing and slicing behavior.

Accordingly, constructor arguments are interpreted as for bytearray().

Bytes objects can also be created with literals, see String and Bytes literals.

See also Binary Sequence Types ¡ª bytes, bytearray, memoryview, Bytes Objects, and Bytes and Bytearray Operations.

callable(object)
Return True if the object argument appears callable, False if not. If this returns true, it is still possible that a call fails, but if it is false, calling object will never succeed. Note that classes are callable (calling a class returns a new instance); instances are callable if their class has a __call__() method.

New in version 3.2: This function was first removed in Python 3.0 and then brought back in Python 3.2.
